# Module 1 Challenge: Horiseon Landing Page

## Description

This webpage was refactored to ensure it follows accessibility standards. The motivation behind the refactoring is for the marketing agency's site to be optimized for search engines. Through refactoring this website, I had the opportunity to review semantic elements of HTML, the sequential structuring of HTML and adding alt attributes to image elements to enhance their accessibility.
